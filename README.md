## Acknowledgements
- The book [HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10361330-html-and-css) by [Jon Duckett](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/135171.Jon_Duckett) was helpful sometimes, it also inspired the home page design (page 323)
- Just as the previous mentioned book was helpful sometimes, the website [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) was a great asset, especially for me to understand margins and paddings a bit better
- The guy over on Tutor Assistance at Code Institute that helped me with what to put as action in the contact form, I was trying to figure it out for days
- My family who kept pushing that I can make this happen, since I have bad anxiety and zero self esteem
- The GitHub user 4n4ru and her perfectly made [readme.md](https://github.com/4n4ru/CI_MS1_BodelschwingherHof/blob/master/README.md) file, whithout it as a template I don't think I would've been able to put a readme.md file together
- Also not to forget my mentor Mo Shami that got me to actually start working on the project and helped me on the way
